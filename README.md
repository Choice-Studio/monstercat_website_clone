# ðŸš€ Astro Webapp Template:

Documentation for this isn't exceptionally deep, as I expect myself to be the only user of this repo. If you'd like to start from this repo yourself, however, Astro provides great documentation [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

Luckily, Astro provides magical support for most frameworks and libraries anyone might want to use. Unlike Webpack, Astro really does most of the work for you.

## ðŸ“‘ Instructions:

#### **npm installs:**

```
npm install
```

#### How to start:

In development do:

```
npm run dev
```

For production, do:

```
npm run build
```

To detach from git, run:

```
rm -r -f .git
```
