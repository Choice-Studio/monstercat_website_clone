# ðŸŽ§ Monstercat Website Clone

Monstercat is one of the many websites featured on[ frontendpractice.com](https://frontendpractice.com), and I credit FEP for my initial discovery of the Monstercat webpage. You can have a look at the original at [monstercat.com/release/MCLP017](https://www.monstercat.com/release/MCLP017).

The website, so far, is being constructed with AstroJS (duh), SCSS and a little vanilla JavaScript.

For now, please have a look at what I've done at [monstercat-clone.netlify.app](https://monstercat-clone.netlify.app).
