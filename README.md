# ðŸŽ§ Monstercat Website Clone

Monstercat is one of the many websites featured on[ frontendpractice.com](https://frontendpractice.com), and I credit FEP for my initial discovery of the Monstercat webpage.

The website, so far, is being constructed with AstroJS (duh), SCSS and a little vanilla JavaScript.

For now, please have a look at what I've done at [ableton-choice.netlify.app](https://ableton-choice.netlify.app).git

## ðŸ“‘ Instructions:

#### **npm installs:**

```
npm install
```

#### How to start:

```
npm run dev
```

For production, do:

```
npm run build

To detach from git, run:

```
rm -r -f .git
```
